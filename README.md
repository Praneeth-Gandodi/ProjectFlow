## Credits

This project was made possible with the collaboration and inspiration of the following tools and platforms:

- **Firebase Studio** — for providing the initial blueprint and backend-ready structure.  
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** — for all code corrections, logic structuring, feature additions, and UI/UX refinements.  
- **Copilot** — for generating the favicon and offering intelligent code completions.
